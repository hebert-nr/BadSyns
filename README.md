The goal of Bad Syns is to have your team guess the movie title by describing a poorly/uncomfortably written sysnopsis of said movie. 
You can play for points. You can play for fun. In the end, we're all winners here.

How to play:
Split into teams (if you want). The person reading rotates each turn (pass left, or right, whatever you prefer). Reader reads synopsis, team must guess before time runs out. 60 seconds per round. If team is unable to guess based off synopsis, reader may include actors involved and year movie was made. When round is over, pass to other team.

How to score:
Team guesses using only synopsis is worth 2. Guesses using actors and or year worth 1.

First team to get to like, 16 points? wins. 

Or just keep playing because we're all having fun!
